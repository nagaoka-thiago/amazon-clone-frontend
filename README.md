## Description

It has a purpose to improve my knowledge on ReactJS, Java Spring Boot and recycling my habilities on HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

As I said before, it is inspired by the youtube's channel Clever Programmer's amazon clone project, which they built in one week. Their project has Google Authentication, add to and delete from cart functionallity, which increases the amount of items of that product on cart each time you click on "Add to cart". Its database are built on Firebase.

My version of their project has its own simple user authentication.
